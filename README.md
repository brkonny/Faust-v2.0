If no parameters are entered, a program will warn you that you haven't chosen any of them and no actions will be taken unless you add the parameters from section which is built into Windows.

It is highly recommended to add this program to antivirus exceptions. This may sound akward, but as the digital licenses can be very costy, this software isn't signed. That's why some antiviruses may detect actions of this software solution as suspicious, because it is making, deleting or modifying selected files.
Also, it is recommended to add this program to firewall exceptions, because one of the features of this software, the so-called "CIP na Email", communicates with Google Mail servers in order to send an email to a client. Some third-party firewall solutions may block the actions of the program and an exception will be raised.

You can find list of the programs and its purposes here on Github Wiki tab.
