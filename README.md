If you don't choose any of these parameters, a program will warn you that you haven't chosen any of them and no actions will be made until you enter parameters that are required for program to run.

We highly recommend to add this program to antivirus exceptions. We assure you that it hasn't got any viruses at all, but some antivirus solutions may detect actions of this software solution as suspicious, because it is making, deleting or modifying selected files.
Also, we recommend  to add this program to firewall exceptions, because one of the programs in this software, CIP na Email, communicates with Google Mail servers in order to send an email to a client. Some third-party firewall solutions may block the actions of the program and an exception will be raised.
